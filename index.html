        <p class="intro__text">
          According to polls, 95% of Russians dream of travelling somewhere,
          but&nbsp;only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their home country.
          They say, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a
          whole universe with the gentle seas of the south, the dense forests of
          the Sayan Mountains and the rugged ice of the Putorana plateau. And
          you can see all of these beauties without millions of dollars account,
          passports and hours-long flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova
          is a brave young mum who took all her three children, put them in her
          Lada and drove 20,000 kilometres across her home country. There are
          some interesting places worthy of your holiday.

              Altai is the one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of
              all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you
              will see slopes covered with pine trees, mountain rivers and
              lakes. And if you open the car window, you can get acquainted with
              the invisible miracle of the area - the mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              Altai has a moderate climate, so it is best to come here in
              summer. This way you will see all the variety of local flora and
              fauna. In the forests of Altai roam elk, eagles fly over the
              ridges and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manulas
              are also inhabitants of the Altai region.

              Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many
              people also know that it is the largest source of fresh water and
              one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              Of course, that's all good. But Baikal is also an ideal place for
              skijoring competitions. This is a sport where a skier ties himself
              to a motorbike, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as
              possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record of 197.011
              kilometres per hour was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.

              parks because of the impenetrable bogs which have never known the
              axe. Some of the pine trees are more than half a millennium old.
